# TJU-multi-modality-SIQR-dataset
Multi-modality dataset for stereoscopic image quality ranking of Tianjin University, China.

The multi-modality SIQR database is constructed with 348 distorted images derived from 29 reference images, which contains the subjective ranking information and corresponding EEG signals.

NOTICE: (1) The multi-modality SIQR database is available for non-commercial research purposes only. (2) The EEG acquisition experiment was carried out in the EEG Laboratory, School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering, Tianjin University. (3) You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell or exploit for commercial purposes, any portion of the clips, and any derived data. (4) You agree not to further copy, publish, or distribute any portion of the multi-modality SIQR database. Except for internal use at a single site within the same organization, it is allowed to make copies of the dataset.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD: (1) This database is publicly available. It is free for professors and researcher scientists affiliated to a University. The download link is as follows: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iivDwKVVA4oQFYAUbGjieA (2)Permission to use but not reproduce or distribute the multi-modality SIQR database is granted to all researchers given that the following steps are properly followed: Send an E-mail to Lili Shen (sll@tju.edu.cn) before downloading the database. You will need a password to access the files of the multi-modality SIQR database. Your E-mail MUST be set from a valid University account and MUST include the following text:
